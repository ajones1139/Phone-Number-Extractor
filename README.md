# Phone-Number-Extractor
📞 Phone Number Extractor with Regex
This project is a Python script that extracts phone numbers from unstructured text using regular expressions. It showcases practical use of Python’s built-in re module to build and test patterns that match various phone number formats.

🔍 Why I Built This
I initially found regular expressions confusing, especially when I first tried using them in Python over a year ago. But while working helpdesk, I began encountering real-world use cases—particularly in PowerShell scripts and log analysis—that helped me develop confidence and curiosity around regex. That hands-on exposure eventually made Python’s implementation click.
As I’ve grown more skilled with web scraping, scripting, and cybersecurity simulations, I’ve come to see regex as an essential tool for both technical and everyday automation tasks like data cleanup and pattern detection.

🧠 What I Learned
How to build flexible regex patterns to handle multiple formats
How to use escape characters like \s, \+, and others correctly
How to compile patterns and apply them across multiline files
The value of tools like regex101 for testing and debugging

🚧 Future Plans
Expand pattern matching to include emails and other structured data &
Build a simple GUI for non-technical users to extract text-based data
Potentially wrap the tool in a web app or lightweight CLI
