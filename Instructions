## ðŸ“„ What the Script Does

- Uses a **regex pattern** to identify phone numbers with optional country codes, area codes (with or without parentheses), various separators (spaces, dashes, dots), and optional extensions  
- Extracts phone numbers from the provided text (from a file or pasted input)  
- Determines the type of phone number (e.g., Toll-Free, International, With Extension, Legacy, or Standard) based on pattern matching and nearby context  
- Prints all extracted phone numbers along with their classified types

## ðŸ›  Code Structure Highlights

- Uses **functions** (`extract_phone_numbers` and `identify_type`) to organize reusable logic  
- Employs **conditional statements** to handle different input sources (file or pasted text)  
- Includes helpful **comments** to make the code accessible and easy to understand
